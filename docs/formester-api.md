## Rate Limiting Policy

To ensure the stability and fair usage of Formester's API, we have implemented a rate limiting policy. This policy restricts the number of requests that can be made to our API within a specified time period.

- **Maximum Requests:** You are allowed to make a maximum of 10 requests to our API every 60 seconds.

If you exceed the specified rate limit, your additional requests may be denied within the throttling window. To prevent being throttled, please ensure that your application adheres to the rate limiting policy.

We appreciate your understanding and cooperation in maintaining the performance and availability of Formester's API. If you consistently encounter rate-limiting issues or have specific needs that require a higher rate limit, please contact our support team at [support@formester.com](mailto:support@formester.com) to discuss your requirements.
