# Introduction to Formester API

Formester provides a powerful REST API for managing and analyzing form submissions. Our API allows you to interact with Formester programmatically, giving you access to your forms and submission data.

## API Versions

We currently offer two API versions:

- **[API v1](./formester-api-v1.md)** - Form-level token authentication, ideal for single-form integrations
- **[API v2](./formester-api-v2.md)** - Organization-level access with improved response formats

## Quick Comparison

| Feature | v1 | v2 |
|---------|----|----|
| Token scope | Form-level | Organization-level |
| Token access | Contact support | Self-service via UI |

## Getting Started

- **For v1**: Contact our support team at [support@formester.com](mailto:support@formester.com) to obtain your token.
- **For v2**: Visit [app.formester.com/api](https://app.formester.com/api) in your Formester dashboard to generate your token.

For new integrations, we recommend starting with API v2.
